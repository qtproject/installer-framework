Shows how to translate the installer UI.

You have to call lrelease on the included .ts file before building the installer.

Generate installer with

binarycreator --offline-only -c config/config.xml -p packages installer

You can now run the installer in German.

Linux:

LANGUAGE=de ./installer

On OS X and Windows you need to adapt the system settings to set German as preferred language, and then start the installer.
